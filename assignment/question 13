           â€¢ What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?

         Answer:-
         
            -> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

            # Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements

                   -> An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML elment.



            # Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section

                   -> An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

                   -> An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.



            # External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

                   -> An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

                   -> To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:
