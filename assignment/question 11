            • How to center block elements using CSS1?

         Answer:-

         
           -> To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the <center> tag. All the elements within the <center> tag will
         be centrally aligned.

           -> The way to do that is to set the margins to 'auto'. This is normally used with a block of fixed width, because if the block 
         itself is flexible, it will simply take up all the available width. Here is an example: P.blocktext { margin-left: auto; margin-right:
         auto; width: 8em } .

           -> In this article, we will see how to make block-level elements to the center using CSS. 


           Step 1: Define the external width – We need to define the external width. Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the
         webpage, so for centering the block element, we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.
 
           Step 2: Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto – Since we produced a remaining space by providing external 
         width so now we need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to
         align a remaining space.
