    <!-- Question:-18
           â€¢ What are the media types allowed by CSS?

         Answer:-
            
            # CSS2 Introduced Media Types:-

            -> The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media 
            types.

            -> Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld
             devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

            -> Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

   
            # CSS3 Introduced Media Queries

            -> Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they
             look at the capability of the device.

            -> Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

                   # width and height of the viewport
                   # orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
                   # resolution
 
            -> Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops,
             tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).
