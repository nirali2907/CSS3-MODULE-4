    <!-- Question:-9
           â€¢ Which property controls the image scroll in the background?

       #  Answer:-
           -> The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page.

           -> The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment of the background image with respect to its
         container. It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. 

           -> Setting the value to scroll , the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add
         a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it): You can use the overflow property when you want to have 
         better control of the layout.
