    <!-- Question:-10
            â€¢ Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

       #  Answer:-
            
            -> There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in 
         CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

            -> background is a shorthand property that allows you to set all the background properties  in one  line. On the other hand, background-color property sets the color of the background of an element.

            -> The background-color property sets the background color of an element. The background of an element is the total size of the 
         element, including padding and border (but not the margin). Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to
         read.
            
            -> So the background property can be used as a convenient short-hand that can apply multiple declarations in one line, and save you
         many lines of code. Declaration = CSS property + value. The background-color property, on the other hand, can only set the background 
         color of an elment.
