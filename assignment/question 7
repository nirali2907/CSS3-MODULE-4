    <!-- Question:-7
            .. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

       #  Answer:-
             
             ->  This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the
             repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both
             horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

             -> To make a background image not repeat in HTML, specify no-repeat in the background-repeat property or the
             background shorthand property. The background image is set to 'no-repeat' using the 'background-repeat'
             property.

             -> The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be 
             repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes.
