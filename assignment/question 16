    <!-- Question:-16
            â€¢ What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?

         Answer:-

             # External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:

             -> one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages.

             -> you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements.

             -> consistent look and feel across multiple web pages.

             -> Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.

             -> Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.

             -> In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.


             # The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:

             -> In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.

             -> Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.


             -> CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.

             -> With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test
              for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.

              -> After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects 
              on all the browsers.
