    <!--Question:-17
           â€¢ What is the meaning of the CSS selector?

         Answer:-
         
           ->  A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the
         browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

           -> CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

           :-> We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

 
           # Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
           # Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
           # Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
           # Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
           # Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
