    <!-- Question:-15
            â€¢ What are the external style sheets?

         Answer:- 

             -> An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head 
         section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. 

             -> External style sheets are created in separate documents with a .css extension. An external style sheet is
         simply a listing of CSS rules. It cannot contain HTML tags. The tag, which goes in the head of an HTML page, is
         used to link to an external style sheet. 

             -> An external style sheet is simply a listing of CSS rules. It cannot contain HTML tags. The <link> tag, 
         which goes in the head of an HTML page, is used to link to an external style sheet. There is no limit to the
         number of external style sheets a single HTML page can use.
