    <!-- Question:-5
             â€¢ What do you understand by CSS opacity?

         Answer:-
         
         ->    The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind 
        aelement is hidden.

         ->     The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element. The opacity-level describes the transparency-
        level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% 

         ->     Opacity is measured by how much light passes through an object. Objects with lower opacity allow more
          light to pass through them, therefore becoming more see-through. The more solid an object is the less light 
          that can pass through it translates to a higher opacity.

       #Example:-

        #  color opacity:
          ->     Opacity. The CSS opacity property sets the opacity for the whole element (both background color and text 
          will be opaque/transparent). The opacity property value must be a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 
          1.0 (fully opaque).

   
        # Image Transparency with the CSS Opacity Property:
          ->      The opacity property takes values from 0.0 to 1.0 , with 1 being the default value for all elements. 
          The lower the value, the more transparent. So if an element is given an opacity of 0.
