      <!-- Question-8
               â€¢ What is the use of the background-position property?


            Answer:-
                  -> The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is
                placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
   
                 -> The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is relative to the
                 position layer set by background-origin .

                  -> The background shorthand CSS property sets all background style properties at once, such as color, image, origin and size,
                 or repeat method. Component properties not set in the background shorthand property value declaration are set to their default 
                 values.
